# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plans on improving the Future:

_Prospective Site Name: Prasadam Tea & Coffee_

_Prospective Sloan: "Serve the Tea"_

_What would complement this website is an "Order Now", or "Place your Order" page. It would include all elements necessary to process a purchase order, including an order form, a shopping cart, payment method, and a link to a directional map. Visualizing your order is important in customer service and marketing so a photo catalogue of each menu item will be included_
